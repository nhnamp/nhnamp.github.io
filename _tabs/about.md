I'm currently a freshman in the major of Information Security (Honors Program) at University of Information Technology (UIT) - Vietnam National University (VNU-HCM).

This is my personal blog, where I can share notes on interesting knowledge I gain through courses, solutions for challenges from competitions I participate in, and maybe some other fun stuff.
